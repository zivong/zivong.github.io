## Roger Penrose's Foreword

In the edition published in 2005, a foreword written by [Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose) was included.

Penrose commented that what distinguishes Pais' book from numerous biographies of Einstein is "the detail and insight into Einstein's scientific contributions, with not so much emphasis on issues of a personal nature."

Penrose introduced that Einstein made ground-breaking work in almost every field of physics at the beginning of the 20th century, and Pais introduced Einstein's contributions in this way:

> Pais first sets the stage, lucidly describing the state of the relevant parts of physics at the time Einstein entered the scene, often explaining in significant detail the work of Einstein’s precursors. Then we find Einstein’s own fundamental contributions, introduced and discussed in-depth, the essential novelty of Einstein’s viewpoint being all very clearly set out, as is the profound influence that it had on subsequent work.
