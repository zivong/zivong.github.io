*The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta* is a science book for the lay reader. Written by the physicists Albert Einstein and [Leopold Infeld](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Infeld/), it traces the development of ideas in physics. It was originally published in 1938 by Cambridge University Press. The version I read is the [2008 edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005VQYUD6) published by Touchstone.

## I. The Rise of the Mechanical View

### The Great Mystery Story

A good theory can not only explain existing facts but also predict new phenomena.

### The First Clue

Only by doing thought experiments in an ideal environment can we get the correct laws of physics.

The *law of inertia* is obtained through thought experiments. We push an object on a horizontal plane to a certain speed, and then stop pushing, we will observe that the object will not stop immediately, it will continue to move forward for a certain distance and then stop. If the horizontal surface is smoother, the object will move farther after losing thrust. These are observable facts. Then we assume that the horizontal plane is infinitely smooth. Based on the facts mentioned above, we have reason to believe that this object will move infinitely along a straight line at a constant speed after losing its thrust.

It can be seen that a characteristic of thought experiments is to assume a condition that cannot be set in reality, usually assuming that a certain quantity is infinitely small or infinitely large.

When we realize that maintaining a uniform linear motion is an inherent property of an object, it is natural that we can regard the change of the object's velocity as evidence of external effects. No matter how complicated the external effect on the object is, we can abstract this effect as a concept of *force*. Acceleration can be used as a measure of force.
