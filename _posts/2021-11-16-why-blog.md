The original purpose of launching this blog is note-taking. I want to use it as a public notebook.

There are many notes apps, but they are not perfect for me. I hope that the data is completely owned by myself, and I can track the modification history via [Git](https://git-scm.com/); so writing in [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) is the best choice. Then through a static site generator such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I can share these notes with everyone around the world.
