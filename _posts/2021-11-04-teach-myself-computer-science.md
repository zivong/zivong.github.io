[Oz Nova](https://twitter.com/oznova_) and [Myles Byrne](https://twitter.com/quackingduck) had made a [guide](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) for self-taught engineers to learn computer science. They selected some subjects you have to study and listed the best book or video lecture series for each subject. I will generally follow their advice.

## Programming

> Most undergraduate CS programs start with an “introduction” to computer programming. The best versions of these courses cater not just to novices, but also to those who missed beneficial concepts and programming models while first learning to code.

- [ ] [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

## Computer Architecture

> Computer Architecture—sometimes called “computer systems” or “computer organization”—is an important first look at computing below the surface of software. In our experience, it’s the most neglected area among self-taught software engineers.

- [ ] [*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html)
- [ ] [*The Elements of Computing Systems*](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
- [ ] [*Computer Organization and Design*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0124077269)

## Algorithms and Data Structures

> We agree with decades of common wisdom that familiarity with common algorithms and data structures is one of the most empowering aspects of a computer science education. This is also a great place to train one’s general problem-solving abilities, which will pay off in every other area of study.

- [ ] [*The Algorithm Design Manual*](https://www.algorist.com/) by Steven Skiena

> In our opinion, the two more commonly suggested texts (CLRS and Sedgewick) tend to be a little too proof-heavy for those learning the material primarily to help with practical problem solving.

But I like analysis!

- [ ] [*Algorithms*](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) by Sanjoy Dasgupta

## Mathematics for Computer Science

> In some ways, computer science is an overgrown branch of applied mathematics. While many software engineers try—and to varying degrees succeed—at ignoring this, we encourage you to embrace it with direct study. Doing so successfully will give you an enormous competitive advantage over those who don’t.

- [ ] [*Mathematics for Computer Science*](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf) by Eric Lehman, Thomson Leighton & Albert R Meyer

I don't know why the authors ignored the following famous book in this area:

- [ ] [*Concrete Mathematics*](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r97002/temp/Concrete%20Mathematics%202e.pdf) by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth & Oren Patashnik

## Operating Systems

- [ ] [*Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

> After OSTEP, we encourage you to explore the design decisions of specific operating systems, through “{OS name} Internals” style books such as

- [ ] [*Lions' Commentary on Unix*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1573980137/)
- [ ] [*Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321968972/)
- [ ] [*MAC OS X Internals: A Systems Approach*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321278542/)
- [ ] [*Linux Kernel Development*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0672329468)

## Computer Networking

> Given that so much of software engineering is on web servers and clients, one of the most immediately valuable areas of computer science is computer networking. Our self-taught students who methodically study networking find that they finally understand terms, concepts and protocols they’d been surrounded by for years.

- [ ] [*Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0133594149/)

## Databases

- [ ] [CS186 Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/user/CS186Berkeley/videos)
- [ ] [*Architecture of a Database System*](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf)
- [ ] [*Readings in Database Systems*](http://www.redbook.io/)
- [ ] [*Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1558601902)
- [ ] [*Data and Reality: A Timeless Perspective on Perceiving and Managing Information in Our Imprecise World*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1935504215)

## Languages and Compilers

> Most programmers learn languages, whereas most computer scientists learn about languages. This gives the computer scientist a distinct advantage over the programmer, even in the domain of programming! Their knowledge generalizes; they are able to understand the operation of a new language more deeply and quickly than those who have merely learned specific languages.

- [ ] [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom
- [ ] [*Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321486811)

## Distributed Systems

> As computers have increased in number, they have also spread. Whereas businesses would previously purchase larger and larger mainframes, it’s typical now for even very small applications to run across multiple machines. Distributed systems is the study of how to reason about the trade-offs involved in doing so.
