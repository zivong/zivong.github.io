Here are some lists collected by me. Lists give the world some kind of order.

- [Mathematical Reading List](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/admissions/files/reading-list.pdf) by the University of Combridge

  This list of interesting mathematics books and internet sites is mainly intended for sixth-formers planning to take a degree in mathematics. They are divided into three groups: historical and general (to give a broad idea of the scope and development of the subject), recreational (from problem books to technical books), and textbooks.
